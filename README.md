## Synopsis
Modern day biomedicine has been revolutionised by the introduction of molecular diagnostic methods. With recent advancement of high throughput DNA and protein sequencing technologies we are living in the omics era where personalised medicine became a familiar term. Despite significant technological advancement, molecular diagnostic methods are not within the reach of most people in the developing world. For example, antibiotic resistant (Multiple drug resistance or MDR and Extensively drug-resistant or XDR) forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a rising threat to the world and it is necessary to detect the presence of such resistant strains in patient samples as early as possible. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods for the detection of antibiotic resistant form of bacteria exist in the market, but use of such technology is not cost effective and often depend on expensive hardware along with continuous purchase of consumables like specific cartridges. Here, in this project we propose to develop a microfluidics based, reusable module, mainly to detect the presence of antibiotic resistant bacterial genes in patient samples.

## Software

Explain functionality of software components (if any) as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Ideally, this should be pseudo code or an abstract graphical representation of your code e.g entity relationship diagram. Consider adding a screenshot of your User Interface.

## Hardware

Explain how the hardware components (if any) of your project function as concisely as possible, including a short description of fabrication and assembly. Component suppliers and part numbers should be provided separately in a bill of materials, in a 'Hardware Folder'.

## Installation, Maintenance and Testing Guide

Provide instructions on usage, describe a test scheme and show how to run the tests with code and hardware configuration examples with some representative results.
